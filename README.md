# gpt-website

I use #ChatGPT, an #Ai tool, to build a website (https://riodw.github.io/gpt-website) in just a couple hours. It is amazing how quickly and easily this generation of HTML and content is, including the navbar/header, footer and . All without Google and StackOverflow. It comes with #CSS included, and the ability to convert it to #SCSS!


Now:

* Who owns this code generated by the Ai?

* How long until OpenAI releases a competing product to help combat their own #ChatGPT to help companies fight the ease of generating #spam?

* What University will be the first to have a full course on #PromptEngineering?

* When will be the first IPO of a #PromptMarketplace company happen (take https://promptbase.com/ for example)?



The use of with #ChatGPT is so fluid it really is like having a conversation with another engineer moving faster than you can even keep up with. Excited to see what #GPT4 has in store.
